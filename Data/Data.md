# Database  

After finding some workable datasets, we created tables in pgAdmin and linked that to AWS. Currently, we have 4 tables in AWS(Confirmed_planets1, Orbital_radius, Confirmed_planet_orbit, and false_planets). below are the queries we used to create the tables. 

[Data\Confirmed_Planets_Table.sql]
[Data\false_planets.sql]
[Data\Orbital_Radius.sql]
