# Exoplanet Detector

## Presentation:
### Project Overview: 

Our project is Exoplanet detection. Our goal is to develop a machine learning model that will determine which candidates from Keppler Space Telescope dataset are planets or not. 
We chose this topic because we each like and enjoy the scifi genre and we all gravitated towards outer space. We think that automating planet hunting could make the process a little more efficient. It'll also allow scientists and NASA which areas of space to focus on and may lead to more groundbreaking discoveries. We wanted to practice machine learning with a real dataset that provided additional challenges that we wanted to face head on. 

### Data:

Our data comes from the NASA Keppler Space Telescope dataset from Exoplanet Archive at Cal Tech. Data starts in CSV format with 49 features and 9,564 rows. Includes information about the star the object is orbiting, statistics of potential exoplanets (i.e radius, orbital period, etc.)

### Question we hope to Answer:

Given our dataset, can we predict whether or not the observed event represenets a true exoplanet. From the confirmed candidates we find, how many are possibly habitable (based on mass and radius)? 

Can we automate planet detection?
