## Clustering 
# Clustering.ipynb is used to create the clustering graph for our project
# 3d_cluser is a picture of our clustering
## Machine Learning
# Machine_Learning_Finished is the final product of our machine learning
# Machine_Learning_CSV's was data analysis used to make the tables we use for machine learning. 
# The rest of the machine learning files show the process and experimentation as we get to our final product
## Data Analysis
# Merging_column is the finished product of the merged columns with the correct names added 
# Merging_Columns is before the names were added. 
# data exporation is where we first tested with the data set. 
# querying AWS is our first run at quering AWS
# backup code is there because it took a while to merge the columns and we were afraid we'd lose it. 
## habitability
# Planet_orbit_test is where we calculated the habibility of the planets
