        <h5 style="color:white">
        The machine learning process started with a table of 49 columns and 9,564 rows. To reduce some of 
        the clutter, every column that was considered an upper or lower constraint of a constraint already 
        displayed in the table was removed. Then we removed all the false_positive_flags so as to not give 
        our machine learning module a cheat sheet. Beyond that we just removed some columns with skewed 
        data(thousands of 1’s and just hundreds of 0’s) and ended up working with 17 columns when all was 
        said and done. Then to further condense our data we removed all the candidate transit events from 
        the exoplanet_archive_disposition because we couldn’t tell how well the machine learning module was 
        at predicting what are planets if we weren’t sure ourselves. That along with removing any NA’s 
        resulting in our final 7247 rows and 17 column table.

        <h5 style="color:white">
          we chose to do a neural network for our machine learning model because that seemed to fit the 
          best with a large collection of data. We also believed that if NASA did this themselves, 
          this is the model they would have chosen too. From there we split the exoplanet_archive_disposition 
          into 1’s and 0’s and ended up with a good collection of both(2,665 confirmed and 4,582 false positives). 
          The model then splits the data up into train,validate,test data with an 80,10,10 split respectively. 
          Then we ran the model through our extensively generated hidden layers and epochs based on charts and 
          data we ran while testing to receive the best classification report we could.

          <h4 style="color:yellow">Precision-Recall Curve:</h4>
          <h5 style="color:white">
          The precision-recall curve we made shows how the precision and recall of our data is related. 
          There is a large area under the curve which shows that the model is predicting values in a 
          skilled manner. For this project, recall is the most important aspect and we are pleased 
          with how this curve looks.

          <h4 style="color:yellow">Confusion:</h4>
          <h5 style="color:white">
            With 643/725 of the transit events being predicted correctly, this leaves us with an 88.6% accuracy. 
            This gives us a pretty accurate model for predicting if a transit event is a planet or not, but not 
            accurate enough to use it as the sole predictor.

          <h5 style="color:white">
            The classification report shows that precision for false positives is almost .10 more than 
            confirmed transit events.This seems to match with the data since there are more false positives 
            than confirmed planets in the data for the model to train on. But all in all, the average for 
            this model seems to fit at about 88 percent for both precision and recall.
