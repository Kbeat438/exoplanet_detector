                At the beginning of this data exploration, we set out to answer two questions: 1. could we use
                machine learning to automate planet findings? and 2. How many planets in NASA's Kepler dataset are
                potentially habitable? Here we summarize how we fared in answering these questions.

                <h5 style="color:white">
                The simple answer to whether machine learning can be used to automate planet findings is yes, however, it is way more complex of a question than that. Our machine learning model can predict whether a transit event is a planet up to about 88% accurary or roughly prediciting 641 transit events correctly out of 725. This is a rather remarkable percent accuracy given how random and sporatic transit events can be, but unforuntaly, this is not accurate enough to be applicable to NASA's tranist event analysis. If this was a linear regression problem and most of the incorrectly labeled transit events were around the line, that wouldn't be so bad. However, with a good chunk of the transit events mislabeled, the incorrectly labeled transit event is almost as far away from the line as it can be. This makes this model too unreliable for the classification of transit events.

                <h4 style="color:yellow">Planet Habitability</h4>
                <h5 style="color:white">
                As for habitability, after creating a list of conditions established by the <a href="https://phl.upr.edu/home">
                habitable exoplanets catalog</a> at the University of Puerto Rico and then filtering our
                dataframe by those conditions, we were able to assign a habitability score from 0 to 2 to each of the 
                2,620 confirmed exoplanets in the Kepler dataset. A habitability score of 0 meant the planet was
                uninhabitable with an average temperature of less than 200 Kelvin and a radius of either smaller than half
                of Earth's radius or larger than 2.5 earth radii. A habitability score of 1 meant that the planet
                was potentially habitable under optimistic criteria. That is, the planet could be as cool as 200 Kelvin
                or as hot as 330 Kelvin with a radius as small as half that of earth's or as large as 2.5 earth radii. Finally,
                the planets with a score of 2 meet more conservative criteria for habitability: they have a radius greater
                than .5 earth radii and smaller than 1.6 earth radii. As one would expect, the vast majority of Kepler's
                confirmed exoplanets scored a 0 on habitability. 39 -- or 1.5% -- of the exoplanets met the optimistic criteria for 
                habitability while only 10 -- or .4% -- met the conservative criteria. Even so, these numbers may seem high.
                If up to 1.5% of all planets are habitable, that suggests that extraterrestrial life would be common in a
                galaxy of hundreds of billions of stars, but remember, these potentially habitable planets don't necessarily
                have life nor are they necessarily habitable. They merely haven't been disqualified from habitability based
                on their temperature and radius. To add further perspective, Mars, an as-far-as-we-know lifeless 
                and inhospitable rock meets with an average temperature of 210 Kelvin and a radius of .53 earth
                radii.

                <h4 style="color:yellow">Utility</h4>
                <h5 style="color:white">
                Even though NASA's Kepler mission has ended, there are several active planet-finding missions using 
                similar technology including the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. Machine learning algorithms 
                like ours could potentially be adapted for these ongoing missions.
