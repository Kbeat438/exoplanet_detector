        <h5 style="color:white">
        NASA's Kepler planet finding telescope has found thousands upon thousands of objects of interest 
        by detecting slight dimming in far away stars. Sometimes such dimming indicated the transit of an 
        exoplanet -- a world beyond our solar system -- in front of its host star. Other times it was nothing 
        more than noise in the telescope's signal. Confirming the existence of an exoplanet is a painstaking process 
        -- but could it be automated with machine learning? Doing so would give NASA's researchers more time and 
        resources to study these far off worlds.

        We at Team_Brute_Force have been exploring NASA's Kepler dataset in order to construct a machine learning
        algorithm that could tell whether a Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) was more likely to be a true planet
        or a false positive based on the many columns of data returned by Kepler. We did this by separating the KOI
        data into two groups -- confirmed planets and false positives -- and then training our algorithm with a neural
        network to identify patterns that would distinguish the two groups. Our results, as you will see on the 
        <a href="/machine-learning" style="color:lightblue">'Exoplanet Detection with Machine Learning'</a>
        were impressive but it remains to be seen if they are useful.

        Our secondary mission was to evaluate the thousands of confirmed planets for habitability. You can see 
        the results of this analysis in the 'Data Exploration' section below.

        The above chart depicts all the Kepler confirmed exoplanets (when the planets dataset is toggled)
        and all their host stars (when the star dataset is toggled) within 200 light years. The colors
        of the planets indicate temperature with white being the coldest at less than 100 degrees kelvin
        and red being the hottest at over 500 degrees kelvin. Blue (between 200 and 250 kelvin) and green 
        (between 250 and 300 kelvin) indicate surface temperatures not hostile to life. Our Earth which averages
        288 degrees kelvin would appear as green. Of course, temperature is not the only factor in habitability.
        Click on a planet to view it's habitability index using criteria from the <a href="https://phl.upr.edu/home">
        habitable exoplanets catalog</a> at the University of Puerto Rico. As you can see from the sample, the 
        vast majority of those nearby exoplanets are too hot to be habitable -- most likely because
        they orbit very close to their host stars as is indicated by their position on the y-axis. It may be
        that planets closer to their stars are easier to detect since they would transit more often and thus grant us
        more chances to observe them. For reference, Neptune travels around the sun once every 165 Earth years while 
        Mercury achieves the same feat nearly 4 times an Earth year.

        Toggling to the star dataset, you can see that the appearance of the stars matches their actual appearance:
        the smaller, cooler red dwarves appear as smaller red markers while the larger, hotter main class stars appear
        as larger, orange and yellow markers. Note that there are no giant stars in this subset of the data. This may be 
        because planet transits are harder to observe in larger, brighter stars.
